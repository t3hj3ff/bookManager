How to run:

Execute `books.sql` file in MySQL client.

run > `npm install`

For running server install nodemon or run it with `node app.js` command.


For API documentation import `bookManager.postman_collection.json` collection in postman.
In POSTMAN variables are not exported so after auth copy generated token and add it manually in headers with "Authorization":"Bearer <token>"
